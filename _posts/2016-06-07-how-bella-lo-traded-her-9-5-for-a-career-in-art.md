Have you ever felt stuck in your career? Ever thought about quitting
your 9-5 job to follow your passion instead? At some point I think
most of us have, but few do more than think about it.

That's why I was so excited to hear Bella Lo's story --- stuck in a job
she disliked, Bella decided to take the leap from art hobbyist to
professional.

A couple of months later she landed her first design position
at [Wizdy Games](http://wizdygames.com/), a startup that makes
educational games for kids.

Hearing this I immediately wanted to know more --- and she was nice
enough to let me interview her! We talked about how she got into
graphic design, the hardest parts about switching careers, and the
YouTube video that finally made her decide to take the plunge. So,
without further ado, here’s my interview with Bella Lo:

The Way Back To Art
-------------------

**Can you tell me a little bit more about what you do at Wizdy Games?**

--- Sure! I’m Wizdy’s current designer. I design visual content such as
infographics, informational posters and articles, and their
promotional media.

**But you haven't always been working with art and design, right?**

--- Haha, it’s complicated… I took art lessons and was classically
trained all throughout grade school. Maybe I got burned out at that
point. By the time I was in my last year of high school, I didn’t
think it would be practical to pursue a career in art. Plus, I thought
some parts of it were boring. So I decided not to do art anymore, and
stopped everything related to it.

After high school I studied social psychology, focusing on child
development and social influence. I had been volunteering at an
after-school program and wanted to become a counselor. My favorite
thing to do was to hang out with the students, talk to them about
their hobbies, and encourage them to apply themselves and chase their
passions. Little did I know it was advice I probably needed myself!

**Did you have a feeling at the time that you wanted to pursue art as
a career?**

--- No, I had never considered art as a career option before –
deciding to pursue it was very spontaneous. Whenever I got home from
my previous job, I'd watercolor or sketch. If I had a free minute at
work, I'd sketch or doodle. It was very therapeutic for me, but that's
all I saw it as.

After I quit my job and was looking for a new one, I found myself
lingering on creative job postings. I was looking for after-school
programs and non-profits, but what actually got me excited were those
“graphic designer needed” postings! I realized that I had always been
interested in talking to my friends in the creative industry about
their work. One conversation led to another, and I thought, well !@#$,
I might as well just switch!

**What do you think made you dismiss art as a career at first?**

--- A lot of it was the stereotype you keep hearing about how art
students graduate and become Starbucks baristas. I didn't realize how
rude it was to say things like that until recently. What's wrong with
being a Starbucks barista anyway? Nothing!

I dismissed the possibility of entering the creative industry because
I worried too much about what people **might** say about me.
I know better now. There's something magical about jobs where you can
create something. There's risk in it too, but I really admire people
who do what they love.

Taking The Plunge
-----------------

**Do you remember a certain point where you made the decision to get
back into art? Or was it more of a gradual realisation?**

--- A little bit of both. It was a gradual realization, but of course
I had my doubts: I'm starting so late in my life. Shouldn't I just
suck it up and keep doing what I'm already doing? So what if I hate
it, there are people older than me who hate their jobs but they can't
quit can they? What if I can't get a job and just waste my next few
months training for nothing? What am I going to do if my money runs
out and I actually just suck at art and design, and I'll never get
a job? Things like that.

Now the really silly sounding part --- bear with me --- the "!@#$ it"
moment was when I watched Shia Labeouf's infamous ["JUST DO
IT"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0) video. I had heard
my friends talking about it, people referenced it a lot and I thought
“Hah, I love motivational stuff, I’ll check it out”. I think a lot of
people take it as a joke because it's so over the top, but when
I watched the video I felt like he was speaking directly to me. Maybe
I just needed someone to shout "JUST DO IT!” to my face.

The part that really made me decide to just do it was when he said,
"Yesterday, you said tomorrow!" I thought, what if one day I'm 30, or
45 or 50, I still hate my job and think, "I wish I had studied graphic
design when I was 23." Better to do it now, and if I find out I am
terrible then at least I won't regret it later.

I hope I can be that kind of inspiration to somebody, some day. I had
a few friends who were very encouraging as well, so I definitely
didn’t pull myself up by my bootstraps --- I had a lot of help and
encouragement along the way.

Switching Careers
-----------------

**So once you made the decision to switch careers what did you do?**

--- First, I did some research. Google is your friend. I searched for
things like, how do you get started in graphic design? What are some
things you should know before getting into graphic design? What kind
of gear do you need? Is it POSSIBLE to get a job if I start now,
without a degree?

I also met with friends who were more than happy to tell me about
their jobs in graphic design or illustration. Even friends who weren't
in the industry were more than happy to refer me to people. I was
floored by people's willingness to help. If I hadn’t asked, or had
been too embarrassed to talk about it, I wouldn't have gotten any help
and I wouldn't be here right now.

After getting all of that background as to what I was about to do,
I felt a lot more confident. Then I got a subscription to
[Lynda.com](http://lynda.com/). This is not a paid advertisement!
I learned so much from the online lessons and the instructors on that
website --- I can't thank them enough.

**How long did it take before you got your current position at
Wizdy?**

--- I'd say, about 3-4 months. I got the position because a friend was
looking out for me and referred me there. Again, I didn’t pull myself
up on my own bootstraps – a lot of help came my way!

**So you spent those months studying?**

--- Yep! Studying, learning and practicing the design applications,
meeting with people… I also did some freelancing as well! That was
really good practice for me, to use what I had been learning. I posted
some of my work on Facebook and friends and acquaintances started
approaching me about work.

I thought that was so cool – it was really encouraging to hear that
people liked what I was doing enough to message me about it, even if
a project ended up not working out.

Working As A Designer
---------------------

**How do you feel about the present?**

--- I feel great! I love what I'm doing right now. Even though I'm
designing the "small things" like postcards and stickers right now,
I think it's good for me to learn how to do them first. I often stop
and think about how fortunate I am to be in a position where I can
restart my career and enjoy it. There are still doubts nagging at me,
but I try to see if they have any substance --- if not, I just move on
and keep trying.

**Where do you want to go next?**

--- My dream is to work with a passionate team of designers and make
infographics or educational posters. I absolutely love making
something boring into something interesting. There are lots of
exciting things to learn in the world, but people aren’t accessing
that information because it looks boring!

**Thanks a lot Bella, it's been great! Finally, do you have any
parting words of wisdom for those thinking of rebooting their
careers?**

--- If you ever wake up in the morning and tell yourself "I wish
I could just quit my job and follow my passion" --- just do it! And
remember --- do your research!
