This summer I had the privilegie of attending an oil painting class in
Stockholm, taught by the great Farigh Ghaderi.

<!-- i want to share some of what i learned -->

In this post I'll cover some of the equipment we used. I found it
surprisingly hard to find a comprehensive guide for oil painting
equipment online, so hopefully this can be helpful.

This was the *first time ever* I worked with oil paints, so it was not
without trepidation that I enrolled in the class. Just to make sure
I didn't make a complete fool out of myself, I watched a bunch of
YouTube videos and practiced a bit at home first. I still felt like
Bambi on ice when we started painting, but that didn't matter much.
I had a great time and learned a lot---now I hope I can share some of
it with you guys!

Water-soluble oils
------------------

One reason I've been so apprehensive towards oil painting is the idea
that cleanup is difficult and that you have to use a lot of chemicals
--- having to clean brushes with turpentine in my apartment didn't
seem very appealing to me.

However, nowadays there's a miracle of science called *water-soluble
oil paints* --- paint that work just like oils, except that they can
be mixed with water! This makes cleanup much easier since you can just
wash your brushes with some soap instead of having to use strong,
headache-in-a-bottle solvents. There are several brands of
water-soluble oils there, but I opted for Windsor & Newton's Artisan
series.

The Artisan paints are still *oils* --- just like acrylics they are
water-proof when dry, and there should be no discernible differences
in quality. Not surprisingly, when you start messing with a 500 year
old formula there will be detractors. Some claim "real" oils are
superior, but I had never used either so I figured I wouldn't be the
worse for wear.
