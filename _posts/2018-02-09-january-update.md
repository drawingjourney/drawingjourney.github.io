As per my New Years resolutions I started Jason Seilers portrait painting
course last month. The course consists of six lessons and my goal was to have
completed four of them by February.

I started Lesson 2 last week. I'm not really good with estimates.

Anyhow, I feel like I’ve learned a lot so far. I will post an in-depth review
of the course later, but for now I can say it does exactly what it says on the
tin: If you want to learn how to paint portraits so realistic they look like
they could jump out of the canvas and punch you in the face, this the course
for you!

## What I've learned

I thought I'd share some of the things I've learned this month.

### Painting hair

Do you want to know the secret to painting hair? Don't paint hair! I guess this
warrants some explanation...

Individual hairs are extremely fine, but put them together and they almost
start behaving like a solid mass. So, when painting hair, switch between using
a *big* brush for blocking in the general shape of the hair (think of it as a
bunch of big ribbons) and a *tiny* brush for painting individual strands.

I've always had lots of trouble painting hair because I was trying to do
something in-between---using a medium-sized brush to paint something that was
supposed to be individual strands.

### Taking notes

When you follow any type of course, make sure you take notes! I started the
course taking notes in the Mac Notes app, but now I'm using pen and paper. Let
me explain why:

 * Whenever I wanted to take a note I had to resize the video (which was
   playing in full screen on my laptop, for that 13'' home theater experience). 

 * I feel like I retain information better if I write it down on paper. I'm
   sure there are a lot of studies that support this, I just feel it in my gut.

 * It's great to be able to draw and listen at the same time---taking visual
   notes, essentially.

My current setup consists of a pen, mechanical pencils and a set of cool grey
Promarkers. The markers are great for blocking in rough values.

### Setting goals

* Setting (SMART), medium-term goals has worked great - Bobby Chiu and Feng Zhu both talk about this. If you don’t have a course you want to finish you could do something else, like painting 100 eyes or doing a 21 day challenge (Noah Bradley link)
