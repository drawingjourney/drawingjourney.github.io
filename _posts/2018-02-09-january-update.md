I started Jason Seilers portrait painting course last month. It consists of six
lessons, so I thought a reasonable target would be to complete four of them by
the end of February.

It's now February 9th and I just finished lesson one. I guess I'm not good with
estimates.

I will post an in-depth review of the course later, but for now I can say it
does exactly what it says on the tin: If you want to learn how to paint
portraits so realistic they look like they could jump out of the canvas and
punch you in the face, this the course for you!

## What I've learned

As I want to post more often I thought I'd try something new: Every month I'll
post some highlights from what I've learned since last month. Here are some
things I learned in the month of January:

### Painting hair

Do you want to know the secret to painting hair? Don't paint hair! I guess this
warrants some explanation...

Individual hairs are extremely fine, but put them together and they almost
start behaving like a solid mass.

Most of us knows that it's not feasible to paint every single hair on a persons
head, but when we paint we still like to think of hair in terms of strands or
locks. Even if it's not our *intention* to paint individual hairs we still try
to follow the shape of the hair with, say, a medium-size brush.

This is a trap! Instead, use a big brush (no, bigger than that!) to block in
the general values of the hair (shadows, highlights and so on), and then use a
*super fine* brush if you want to add some detail, like a stray lock.

Think of it as painting big, shiny ribbons (henche "don't paint hair").

Two paintings of Luke Skywalker for the Realistic Portraits course. In the left
one I've painted something between large shapes and individual strands. In the
right one the hair is painted loosely and more like a solid mass, and it ends
up looking way better.

### Taking notes

When you follow any type of course, make sure you take notes! I started the
course taking notes in the Mac Notes app, but now I've switched to using pen
and paper. Let me explain why:

 * Whenever I wanted to take a note I had to resize the video (which was
   playing in full screen on my laptop, for that 13'' home theater experience). 

 * It's easier to retain information if you write it down on paper. While this
   might sound like a wild, speculative claim, I'm sure there is ample
   scientific evidence supporting this, involving micro-crystals and "ley
   lines".

 * For something as visual as painting, drawing becomes a highly effective way
   to take notes. This is way easier on paper.

My current setup consists of a pen, mechanical pencils and a set of cool grey
Promarkers. The markers are great for blocking in rough values.

### Setting goals

Setting these New Years goals has worked out great so far; they've boosted my
motivation and given me some clear direction on where to go.

I've had "become a better artist" as a goal for quite some time now, but by
most standards of measurement it's a pretty terrible goal. Not that there's
anything wrong with the goal itself, but it's not very helpful for gauging
progress.

There's a fairly established set of criteria for setting more helpful goals,
with an apt mnemonic: [SMART][smart-goals]. For a goal to meet the SMART
criteria it needs to be:

 * Specific---is it clearly defined and unambiguous?
 * Measurable, e.g. how do you know if you've succeeded?
 * Actionable---does it suggest some concrete step forward?
 * Realistic---is it possible at all to succeed?
 * Time-bound, e.g. when is this thing supposed to be finished?

I've found that setting these kinds of medium-term goals, e.g. finishing an art
course, has been very helpful. It's given me a kind of direction and motivation
I haven't had before. Try it out, it might help you too!

If you donâ€™t have a course you want to finish you could do something else, like
a [21 day challenge][21-days] where you focus on one specific area of your art
that you want to improve.
