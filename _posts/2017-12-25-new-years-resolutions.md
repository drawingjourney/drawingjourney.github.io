I'm a big believer in goal-setting. Last year I set some very
ambitious goals in different areas of my life, like fitness, personal
finance and self-development, with unambigious and clear criteria for
success. Unfortunately this didn't accomplish much other than
generating an impressively diverse list of missed targets.

So, for this year I decided to be a bit more realistic and double down
on something I really care about --- art --- and focus less on other
things.

As such, here is my list of personal art goals for 2018:

## Caricature drawing

I would really like to learn caricature drawing. I've always liked
drawing faces, and playing with proportions and exaggeration seems
really fun. Hopefully it will also help me get better at finding the
likeness of a subject when doing regular portraits as well.

Also, if I want to make money doing art, there always seems to be
a market for caricatures!

To that end, one of my goals for 2018 is to complete a caricature
course, like [The Art of Caricature with Jason Seiler][caricature] on
[Schoolism][schoolism], which I've heard a lot of good things about.

Before learning how to exaggerate, it would makes sense to learn how
to draw "normal" portraits, so I also want to do a course in "regular"
portrait painting, e.g. [Realistic Portraits with Jason
Seiler][portraits].

I've never been very good at completing self-directed courses or books
--- I'm very impatient! --- so I would be happy if I finish even one
of these courses. Hopefully, the public accountability I get from my
readers (both of them) knowing about my goals will help keep me
motivated.

## Figure drawing

Another thing I'd like to improve in 2018 is my figure drawing. I've
actually read a few books on figure drawing in the past, but it wasn't
until I picked up [Figure Drawing---Design and Invention by Michael
Hampton][figuredrawing] that things really "clicked".

The other figure drawing books I've read feels like a sort of showcase
of the different body parts --- "The leg! This is what it looks like!
Now the arm! It looks like this!" --- without much explanation of why
things look the way they do or how they fit into the bigger picture.

Hampton's approach feels way more structured --- he starts with
gesture and landmarks and then builds on that with the skeleton, the
the muscles and so on. I don't know if it's my engineering background,
but I really like going from big picture ideas to specifics, and
understanding the "how" and the "why" things are a certain way.

I've already started the book, but since I want to get better at
finishing things my goal is to work through the whole thing this year.

The one thing I'm worried about is if my fundamentals are good enough.
If not, I might try to complete something like
[drawabox.com][drawabox] first and then get back to the book.

## Summary

I've set some non-art goals for 2018 (like finally getting my driver's
license!) but this isn't my LiveJournal.

However, one goal that is actually relevant is that I'd like to
breathe some life into this blog. Hopefully, dear reader, I'll have
time amidst all my other commitments to update you on my progress!

Have you set any art goals for 2018? If so I'd like to hear them ---
