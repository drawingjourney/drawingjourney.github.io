I started Jason Seiler's [portrait painting course][portrait-course] last
month.  It consists of six lessons, so I thought a reasonable target would be
to complete four of them by the end of February.

It's now February 9th and I just finished the first lesson. I guess I'm not
very good with estimates!

I will post an in-depth review of the course later, but for now I can say it
does exactly what it says on the tin: If you want to learn how to paint
portraits so realistic they look like they could jump out of the canvas and
punch you in the face, this the course for you!

## What I've learned

As I want to post more often I thought I'd try something new: Every month I'll
post some highlights from what I learned. Here are some things I learned in
January:

### Painting hair

Do you want to know the secret to painting hair? Don't paint hair! I guess this
warrants some explanation...

Individual hairs are extremely fine, but put them together and they start
behaving like a solid, shiny mass, almost like a bunch of ribbons. To paint
these "ribbons" you'll want to use a *big* brush to block in the midtones,
shadows and highlights. Afterwards, you can go in with a *super fine* brush and
add some details, like a stray lock, to really "sell" the idea of hair.

However, if you go into the painting thinking that you'll paint *hair* instead
of ribbons it's easy to fall into the trap of painting the hair as individual
strands. Either you'll use a super tiny brush and slowly drive yourself insane,
or do something in-between with a medium-sized brush. It's very time-consuming
and doesn't look great (see below for a comparison). The great James
Gurney also has a post about the ["hair as ribbons"][the-ribbon-secret] idea on
his blog.

In conclusion, don't paint hair---paint ribbons!

one I've painted something between large shapes and individual strands. In the
right one the hair is painted loosely and more like a solid mass, which I think
looks way better.

### Taking notes

When you follow any type of course, make sure to take notes! I started the
course taking notes in the Mac Notes app, but now I've switched to using pen
and paper. Let me explain why:

 * Whenever I wanted to take a note I had to resize the video (which was
   playing in full screen on my laptop, for that 13'' home theater experience). 

 * It's easier to retain information if you write it down on paper. While this
   might sound like a wild, speculative claim, I'm sure there is ample
   scientific evidence supporting this, involving micro-crystals and "ley
   lines".

 * For something as visual as painting, drawing becomes a highly effective way
   to take notes. This is way easier on paper.

My current setup consists of a pen, mechanical pencil and a set of cool grey
Promarkers. I do all my writing with the fineliner, and sometimes use it for
drawing. For more complex drawings I use the pencil to draw a sketch, then
block in values with the Promarkers. I also have a white gel roller that I use
for highlights.

For digitizing my notes, I use the excellent Scannable app for iOS and then
upload them to Dropbox.

### Setting goals

If you read my last blog post you'll remember that I set some [New Year's
resolutions for 2018][new-year]. Having concrete, short-term goals has turned
out to be great for motivation and giving me a sense of direction. 

If you don't have some goals for your artistic development, I highly recommend
setting some!  Bobby Chiu, the founder of [Schoolism][schoolism], has some
great tips for defining artistic goals:

 * Write down your goals!
 * Don’t work on too many goals at the same time---you’ll just spread yourself
   too thin.
 * Be ambitious---what would you aim for if you were guaranteed to succeed?
 * Visualize yourself having already achieved your goal. What would it feel
   like? This is a great source of motivation you can tap in to.
 * Would the end result be worth all the trouble you would have to go through?
   If not, choose a better goal.

Youtube][perfect-bait])

If you don’t have a course you want to finish you could do something else, like
a [21 day challenge][21-days] where you focus on one specific area of your art
that you want to improve.
