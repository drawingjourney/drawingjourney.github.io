I'm a big believer in goal-setting. Last year I set some very
ambitious goals in different areas of my life, like fitness, personal
finance and self-development, with measureable and clear goals for
each category. Unfortunately this didn't accomplish much other than
generating an impressive list of things I *didn't* do!

I think the problem was that I set too many goals I didn't really care
much about. Regarding fitness, for example, if I'm strong enough to lifty
my hands to keyboard level that's plenty.

So, for this year I decided to be a bit more realistic and double down
on something I really care about: Improving my art skills. As such,
here is my list of personal art goals for 2018:

## Caricature drawing

I would really like to learn caricature drawing! I've always liked
drawing faces, and playing with proportions and exaggeration seems
really fun. Hopefully it will also help me get better at capturing
likenesses in more realistic portraits as well. Also, if I want to
make money doing art, there always seems to be a market for
caricatures!

To that end, one of my goals for 2018 is to complete a caricature
course, like [The Art of Caricature with Jason Seiler][caricature] on
[Schoolism][schoolism], which I've heard a lot of good things about.

Before learning how to exaggerate, it would makes sense to learn how
to draw "normal" portraits (right?), so I also want to do a course in
"regular" portrait painting, e.g. [Realistic Portraits with Jason
Seiler][portraits].

## Figure drawing

Another thing I'd like to improve in 2018 is my figure drawing. I've
actually read a few books on figure drawing in the past, but it wasn't
until I picked up [Figure Drawing---Design and Invention by Michael
Hampton][figuredrawing] that things really "clicked".

The other figure drawing books I've read always felt like a sort of
showcase for different body parts---"The leg! This is what it looks
like!  Now the arm! It looks like this!"---without much explanation of
why things look the way they do or how they fit into the bigger
picture.

Hampton's approach feels way more structured---he starts with gesture
and landmarks and then builds on that with the skeleton, the the
muscles and so on. I don't know if it's my engineering background, but
I really like going from big picture ideas to specifics, and
understanding the "how" and "why" of things along the way.

One thing I'm worried about is if my construction drawing fundamentals
are good enough. If not, I might try to complete something like
[drawabox.com][drawabox] first and then get back to the book.

## Don't be a donkey

My track record of finishing books or courses is not great, to be
honest---past a certain point I often get the idea that I should quit
and do something else instead.

While the switch might seem perfectly reasonable at the time---"I can
learn much more effectively from this other book!"---looking back
I don't have much to show for it but a bunch of false starts. You
could liken it to a [donkey that can't decide whether it should first
eat or drink][buridan] and eventually dies of both thirst and
starvation. So, another of my resolutions for 2018 is to not be
a donkey!

## Summary

I've set some non-art goals for 2018 (like finally getting my driver's
license!) but this isn't my LiveJournal so I won't bore you with
those.

However, one goal that is actually relevant is that I'd like to
breathe some life into this blog. Hopefully, dear reader, I'll have
time amidst all my other commitments to update you on my progress!

Have you set any art goals for 2018? If so I'd like to hear
them---feel free to post about them in the comments section below!
