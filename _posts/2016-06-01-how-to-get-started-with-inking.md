![Inking Header Image](/assets/inking-headline.jpg)

Ink is a very versatile and expressive medium, but it's also one of
the most difficult to master. Working with ink can be incredibly
frustrating; all it takes is one small mistake to ruin a perfectly
good drawing, and when you do make a mistake it’s usually hard to
correct.

Inking can also be incredibly rewarding - there's nothing quite like
putting the finishing touches to a nice ink drawing. It's also easy to
get started, the tools are relatively cheap, and there's relatively
little needed in terms of preparation and cleaning.

In the following series of posts I will show you how to get started
with inking. I will also share some my best tips and the most
embarrassing mistakes I’ve made while experimenting with the Black
Art. In this first post I'll review the tools you need to get started.

## Tools

When it comes to inking there are three primary tools to choose from: 

 1. Fine-point pens (a.k.a. multiliners, fineliners or technical pens)
 2. Brushes 
 3. Nib pens (a.k.a. crowquill pens)
    
Which one you use is mainly a matter of preference - you can also mix
and match depending on what results you’re after.

## Fine-point pens

A fine-point pen resembles your everyday ballpoint pen with the
exception that the ink is delivered through a small metal or plastic
tube. This means you have to apply less pressure than with a ballpoint
pen, which gives you more control over your lines.

Fine-point pens are easy to use and less messy than crow quill pens or
brushes, which make them ideal for beginners. The main drawback of
this tool is that you can't vary your line weight the same way you can
with a brush or nib - if you want a thicker line you have to switch to
a bigger pen. We will get to why line weight matters later, but for
now just trust me when I say that it does.

If you decide to go with fine-point pens, make sure you get some
different thicknesses - 0.1mm, 0.3mm and 0.5mm should be a good start.
Some manufacturers sell sets of pens in different sizes at
a discounted price, so be on the lookout for those if you're just
starting out.

## Crow-quill pens

If you're feeling a bit more adventurous you can go for a crow-quill
pen. This pen consists of a shaft with a detachable nib, which is the
star of the show.

The type of line you get depends primarily on the shape and the
firmness of the nib: By applying more pressure you can make a thicker
line - a softer nib gives you more line weight variation, while
a firmer nib gives you a more uniform line.

The main drawback of a crow-quill pen is that you have to dip it in an
inkwell quite frequently. It requires even more dipping than a brush
since the pen deposits more ink on the page. This also means that you
might occasionally have to wait for your lines to dry before you can
work over them, in order for them not to to smear. 

When buying nibs for drawing, make sure you don’t get *calligraphy
nibs* - a calligraphy (or "italic") nib has a flat, blunt tip, which
gives you either a very thin or thick stroke depending on direction,
but nothing in between. A *drawing* nib has a pointy tip that’s split
in two - as you apply pressure the gap widens, yielding a thicker
line.

## Ink brushes

Ah, the brush - the Rolls Royce of inking tools.

When people talk about *ink brushes* they usually mean watercolor
brushes that happen to be used for inking. The reason you want
watercolor brushes is that brushes made for oil or acrylic are much
thicker and not as absorbent. With ink you want a brush that ends in
a fine point and can hold a lot of liquid.

Watercolor brushes come in different sizes which let you produce lines
of different weight. However, itsgreatest strength is that the
same brush can produce a much wider variety of line weights than a nib
pen, but this also makes the line weight more difficult to control.

You can also use a brush to get textures you wouldn’t be able to with
a pen:“Overfilling” the brush with ink lets you make really round and
soft shapes. On the other hand, “underfilling” gives you that “dry
brush” effect which is great for drawing hair, wool or other fuzzy
things. 

There are also brush pens, which have their own ink reservoir. This
makes them easier to work with since you don’t need an inkwell, but it
also means you can’t control how much ink ends up on the brush.

## Which one should you get?

So, what tool should you get? Personally I would recommend starting
with a set of fineliners. Even if you migrate to other tools later you
can keep them around for when you need a controlled line, such as
hand-lettering, drawing mechanical structures or very fine details.

Being a gear nerd I have bought all of them (of course), but to be
honest I’m too insecure with both crow quills and brushes to use them
on finished work just yet. 

A quick tip is that even if your primary tool is not a brush, having
one around is pretty useful for filling large areas with ink, which
can get quite tedious with a pen. In this case you can complement your
other tools with a cheaper model of brush pen, such as the [Sakura
Pigma Brush
Pen](http://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Brush-Pen-Black-Ink/pd/2366).

## Bonus Gear

### Pencil

Unless you’re some sort of *inking god* you’ll probably want to start
off with a pencil sketch and then ink on top of the pencils. Starting
from a sketch means you can make cheap mistakes in pencil first and
avoid expensive mistakes in ink later.

Some people like to use a HB pencil because it’s not too dark and can
be erased easily. Personally I like to use a blue pencil for my
initial sketch - the blue lines are clearly distinguishable from ink
and can easily be filtered out after scanning the drawing.

### Paper

The exact kind of paper you use is not that important, but keep in
mind that ink is a water-based medium, so it will warp lighter stock.
If you’re using a brush you may want to use paper made for
watercolors.

### Whiteout / white ink

Even though it’s not as easy with pencil, correcting mistakes in ink
is still possible. For this you can use either whiteout / correction
fluid or white gel pens. A white gel pen can also be used for adding
detailed highlights to your drawing after the ink has dried.

While some mistakes can be fixed with whiteout, there are those which
simply cannot be undone. For these cases I recommend having an
emergency supply of comfort snacks and a pillow to hit / cry into,
depending on your personality.

## Additional Resources

That’s it for now! Next time I'll talk a bit more about inking
technique, but in the meantime I'll give you some links to some useful
equipment resources:

[Jake Parker's Inktober Page](http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober) has
a great section on inking materials. Also, if you're serious about
inking, definitely join the
[Inktober](https://twitter.com/hashtag/inktober) challenge!

[JetPens](http://www.jetpens.com/) is a great site (perhaps
unsurprisingly) for buying pens, but they also have many helpful
guides for pens and other drawing tools. Here are some relevant
guides from their blog:

 * [Nibs and Nib Holders](http://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-nibs-and-nib-holders/pt/763)
 * [Choosing White Gel Pens and Markers](http://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-choosing-white-gel-ink-pens-and-markers/pt/340)
 * [Technical Pens](http://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-technical-pens/pt/436)

Yuko Shimizu's [Mastering Inking
class](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Mastering-Inking-Basic-and-Pro-Techniques/1970343004)
on Skillshare is a great resource for learning how to ink with
brushes. In fact, most of what I know about brush technique I learned
from her class.
