## Caricature drawing

I would really like to learn caricature drawing! I've always liked
drawing faces, and playing with proportions and exaggeration seems
really fun. Hopefully it will also help me get better at finding the
likeness when doing regular portraits as well.

Also, if I want to make money with my art, there always seems to be
a market for caricatures!

To that end, one of my goals for 2018 is to complete a caricature
course, like [The Art of Caricature with Jason Seiler][caricature] on
[Schoolism][schoolism], which I've heard a lot of good things about.

Before learning how to exaggerate, it would makes sense to learn how
to draw "normal" portraits, so I might also do a course in "regular"
portrait painting, e.g. [Realistic Portraits with Jason
Seiler][portraits].
