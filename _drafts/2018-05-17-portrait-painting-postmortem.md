I sometimes write little "post-mortems" for myself when I've completed
a larger piece. Usually I keep them in my personal notes, but
I thought: Why not share it? After all, someone else might find it
helpful.

I'm still working on Jason Seiler's [Realistic
Portraits][portrait-course] and the assignment for Lesson 4 was to do
one value study and one finished painting.

## Reference

First things first---reference! Finding good reference is important;
I want something that's inspiring, but it must also be a good
photograph, i.e:

If the photo is too overexposed the painting will lose a lot of depth.
Similarly, if the subject isn't lit properly it risks looking flat.
Finally, it must be high enough resolution that details don't become
blurry when you zoom in.

I use Pinterest like crazy, so that's where I go to find my reference.

A tip: Remember that Pinterest doesn't always save full-resolution
images, so try to find the original image if you want the highest
resolution possible.

Most Pinterest pins link directly to the page the image is taken from,
but you can also use [Google Reverse Image Search][images-google]
(right-click on the image if you're using Chrome) to find the source.

## Sketch

The second part is the sketch. For this part I don't really have any
particular process that I follow; I usually start with sketching out
the larger shapes (e.g. an egg for the head shape, etc).

One thing I've learned is that it really pays off to *measure a lot*!
Use your pencil or some other tool to measure the distances between
different landmarks on the body, e.g. the distance between nose and
chin.

Try to establish some "basic unit" that you can use for measuring,
e.g. if you first measure the width of the eye you can use that to
determine the distance between the eye and the ear, or the other eye,
etc.

To borrow a bit of sales jargon: *Always Be Measuring!*

I usually try to sketch in some of the values at this stage, since it
gives you another set of landmarks to aid in measuring.

For this painting I probably should've probably made the sketch a bit
tighter. There were some lines that weren't quite right that gave me
a lot of trouble later. For example, the contour of her chin isn't
right (???). Also, I completely screwed up the hand, which I either
ignored or didn't notice.
