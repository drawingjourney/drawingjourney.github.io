I sometimes write little "post-mortems" for myself when I've completed
a larger piece. Usually I keep them in my personal notes, but
I thought why not share it? After all, someone else might find it
helpful.

I'm still working on Jason Seiler's [Realistic Portraits
course][realistic-portraits] and the assignment for Lesson 4 was to do
one value study and one finished painting.

Just a note before you read any further: This is *not* a tutorial as
much as it's a peek into the hot mess that is my working process. I'm
no expert, so take from this what you will. You have been warned!

## Reference

First things first---reference! Good reference is important;
I want something that's inspiring, but it must also be a good
photograph, e.g. if the photo is overexposed the painting will lose
a lot of depth. If the subject isn't lit from an angle that
helps describe its it risks looking flat. Finally, it must be high
enough resolution that details don't become blurry when you zoom in.

I'm a Pinterest user (read: addict), so that's where I usually go to
find reference.

A tip: Remember that Pinterest doesn't always save full-resolution
images, so try to find the original image if you want the highest
resolution possible!

Most Pinterest pins link directly to the page the image is taken from,
but you can also use [Google Reverse Image Search][images-google]
(right-click on the image if you're using Chrome) to find the source.

## Sketch

The second part is the sketch. For this part I don't really have any
particular process that I follow; I usually start with sketching out
the larger shapes (e.g. an egg for the head shape, etc).

To sort of help establish the tilt of the head I'll draw the keystone
and the contour of the eyebrows, and then start sketching out more
features.

One thing I've learned is that it really pays off to *measure a lot*!
I use my pencil or some other tool to measure the distances between
different landmarks on the body, e.g. the distance between nose and
chin, distance between brow and hairline and so on.

Try to establish some "basic unit" that you can use for measuring,
e.g. if you first measure the width of the eye you can use that to
determine the distance between the eye and the ear, or the other eye,
etc.

To borrow a bit of sales jargon: *Always Be Measuring!*

I usually try to sketch in some of the values at this stage, since it
gives me another set of landmarks to aid in measuring.

For this painting I probably should've probably made the sketch a bit
tighter. There were some lines that weren't quite right that gave me
a lot of trouble later. For example, the contour of her chin isn't
right (???).

Also, I completely screwed up the hand, which I either ignored or
didn't notice. If you compare it to the original picture you can see
what I mean.

One takeaway here is that I was too lazy to really commit to the shape
of the hand in the sketch stage, which is a mistake I make all the
time. A sketch can be loose, but it shouldn't be ambiguous. I need to
get that tattooed on my forearm.

## Value painting

Now for the fun part, where we get to take out the paints! (Or at
least get to press the "Paintbrush" shortcut on your keyboard)

One piece of advice Jason likes to repeat is to *not zoom in* too
soon!  Instead, zoom *out* and block in the basic values, using a big
honkin' brush. Keep your reference next to your painting and squint to
help you see the differences in value more closely.

Basically the painting process goes like this:

1. Squint and block in
1. Compare the reference and your picture. Do they look the same?
  * If yes, zoom in and go back to step 1.
  * If no, keep painting

Sometimes it can get hard to spot the differences between your
painting and the reference. Unfortunately, this is usually *not* due
to the fact that you just happend to create a perfect copy of your
reference. Most of the time it's because you see *something* is wrong
but can't spot what.

I've got a bunch of tricks I like to use, like:

 * Flipping the canvas horizontally. This makes errors pop out like
   corn kernels in a microwave. Create a keyboard shortcut for this
   (if there isn't one already) so you can flip back and forth
   quickly.

 * Zooming out. This is like computer-assisted squinting. I really
   should remember to use this more often.

<!--Basically I just keep going like this until I'm happy with the-->
<!--result or I get so tired of the painting I can't stand it any longer.-->

Then I just keep going like this until I'm happy with the painting or
I get sick of it, whatever comes first.

After that it gets shipped of to the social media factory where it's
packaged and transformed into ContentÂ® for the Internet to consume.
